Group Task Backend is the server side of a task management system. It is built with Node.js and Express, and it uses MongoDB as the data store. The backend handles user authentication, data modeling for users, projects, and tasks, and it exposes RESTful endpoints for full create, read, update, and delete operations.

Key ideas you’ll find here:
- A robust API that validates users via JSON Web Tokens.
- Clear data models for users, projects, and tasks.
- Modular code that keeps routes, controllers, and data access separate.
- Secure by default with middleware for authentication, authorization, and input validation.

---

## Why this backend exists

This backend serves as the stable, scalable core for a group task management app. It provides a dependable API layer that a frontend client can talk to. The backend is designed to be easy to run locally, easy to test, and straightforward to deploy. It aims to be small enough to understand in one sitting, but featureful enough to cover real-world collaboration flows.

---

## Core features

- User accounts with registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Project creation and management
- Task creation, assignment, and tracking within a project
- Full CRUD operations for users, projects, and tasks
- Secure routes protected by authentication
- Data validation to reduce invalid entries
- Error handling that returns consistent messages
- Simple, well-documented API surface

---

## Tech stack

- Node.js as the runtime
- Express.js as the web framework
- MongoDB as the database
- Mongoose as the ODM
- JSON Web Tokens for authentication

These choices keep the backend fast, flexible, and easy to extend. The codebase follows RESTful API principles and uses middleware to keep concerns separate.

---

## Architecture and data flow

Client requests arrive at the Express server. Middleware checks the token when required. Controllers validate input, and services perform business logic. Data is stored in MongoDB via models defined with Mongoose. The API returns structured responses and meaningful error messages.

ASCII view:
- Client -> API Gateway (Express) -> Auth Middleware -> Routes -> Controllers -> Services -> Models -> MongoDB
- Responses flow back through the same path to the client

---

## Getting started

This guide helps you bring the backend into a local development environment quickly.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (18.x or later)
- npm (6.x or later) or pnpm/yarn (optional)
- MongoDB (either a local server or a cloud instance)

Quick setup
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
- Create a configuration file with required environment variables
- Run the server in development mode

Example commands
- Clone: git clone https://github.com/hsgofficial1113/group-task-backend.git
- Install: npm install
- Copy sample env: cp .env.example .env
- Start: npm run dev
- Test: npm test

Environment variables
- PORT: Port to run the server
- MONGO_URI: Connection string to your MongoDB
- JWT_SECRET: Secret key for signing tokens
- JWT_EXPIRES_IN: Token lifetime, e.g., 1h
- LOG_LEVEL: Logging detail (info, debug, error)
- APP_ENV: Environment type (development, staging, production)

Local development tips
- Use a local MongoDB instance for quick testing
- Seed data during development to speed up testing
- Enable verbose logs while debugging

Project structure (high level)
- src/
  - config/               // Configuration and environment helpers
  - controllers/            // Route handlers
  - models/                 // Mongoose models (User, Project, Task)
  - routes/                 // API route definitions
  - middlewares/            // Auth, validation, error handling
  - services/               // Business logic
  - utils/                  // Helpers and utilities
  - server.js                // App entry point
- test/                     // Tests for endpoints and business logic

Environment and startup notes
- The backend is designed to run with a connected MongoDB instance. If MongoDB isn’t reachable, the server will fail fast with a clear error.
- Logging is intentionally simple to read. In development, you’ll see request logs, authentication events, and errors with stack traces when needed.

## API reference (overview)

All endpoints are prefixed with /api by convention. Authentication is required for most operations, except user registration and login.

Users
- POST /api/users/register
  - Create a new user account
  - Request body: { "name": "...", "email": "...", "password": "..." }
  - Response: user data and a JWT

- POST /api/users/login
  - Authenticate and receive a JWT
  - Request body: { "email": "...", "password": "..." }
  - Response: { token, user }

- GET /api/users/me
  - Get current user profile (requires auth)
  - Response: user data

Projects
- GET /api/projects
  - List projects owned by the user (or accessible to them)

- POST /api/projects
  - Create a new project
  - Request body: { "name": "...", "description": "...", "dueDate": "..." }

- GET /api/projects/:projectId
  - Get project details

- PUT /api/projects/:projectId
  - Update project fields

- DELETE /api/projects/:projectId
  - Remove a project

Tasks
- GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks
  - List tasks for a project

- POST /api/projects/:projectId/tasks
  - Create a new task within a project
  - Request body: { "title": "...", "description": "...", "status": "todo|in-progress|done", "assigneeId": "..." }

- GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId
  - Get a single task

- PUT /api/projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId
  - Update a task

- DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId
  - Delete a task

Response shape (typical)
- Success: { success: true, data: { ... } }
- Error: { success: false, error: { code, message, details } }

Examples
- Register: returns user and token
- Login: returns token and user
- List projects: returns an array of projects with id, name, description, owners, and related metadata
- List tasks: returns an array with task objects including title, status, and related project

End-to-end test considerations
- Tests should cover authentication, authorization, and each CRUD operation
- Tests should verify error conditions, such as invalid tokens or missing fields
- Tests should run against a test MongoDB instance to avoid touching production data

## Data models

User
- id
- name
- email

## Validation, security, and reliability

Authentication
- JWTs are used for session management
- Bearer token is passed in the Authorization header
- Token expiration is configurable

Authorization
- Access controls are enforced at route level
- Only project owners or assigned members can modify project or task data

Input validation
- Validate all incoming data to avoid bad requests
- Centralized error handling returns consistent error responses

Error handling
- Distinct error types for validation, authentication, authorization, and server issues
- Clear messages for developers and safe messages for clients

Logging
- Basic request logging in development
- Structured logs in production (JSON) to aid monitoring

Observability
- Include unique request IDs to trace issues across services
- Provide basic metrics endpoints for health and readiness checks

---

## Testing and quality

Testing strategy
- Unit tests cover core data models and utilities
- Integration tests cover API endpoints and authentication flows
- End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios

Tools
- Jest for tests
- Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing

Workflow
- Tests run on pull requests and on merges to main
- Linting and formatting checks run as part of CI

---

## Deployment and distribution

Docker
- A Dockerfile builds the backend image
- A docker-compose.yml can start the backend with MongoDB in a local environment

Sample docker-compose setup
- Starts a MongoDB container
- Builds and runs the backend service
- Maps ports for local access

Environment considerations
- In production, use a managed MongoDB instance or a dedicated cluster
- Use a reverse proxy if exposing the app publicly
- Enable TLS for secure communication

Release artifacts
- The project publishes release packages containing a ready-to-run build
- To obtain the latest build, visit the Releases page and download the artifact
